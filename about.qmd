## About me

Hi! I'm Faustine, a first year Psychology graduate student at Princeton University. My primary advisor is Dr. Diana Tamir and my secondary advisor is Dr. Erik Nook.

I'm currently studying how the dynamics of spontaneous thought facilitate emotion regulation. Prior to starting my PhD, I received a B.A in Psychology and a B.A in Philosophy from Brown University in 2020.
